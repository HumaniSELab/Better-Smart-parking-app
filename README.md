# Better Smart parking app

Finding a parking space can be very stressful and time consuming. A variety of different vehicle parking applications have been developed but many fail to support diverse end-users. We captured diverse human-centric issues from user reviews and literature, and then created personas that encompass a wide representative range of parking app user groups. Using these personas, user stories were created, categorized and parking app tasks prioritized. We used these to develop a prototype new “smart parking app”. A cognitive walkthrough was employed using each of the personas and user stories to evaluate the app. With more human-centric factors taken into account in the design and development of the app, we found that majority of the human-centric frustrations identified were resolved when compared with a commonly used parking app.

The main contributions of this work include:

we identified key challenges with current smart city apps – specifically for parking – in failing to meet diverse end-user human-centric needs
we developed a set of personas to represent these diverse parking app end-users
we developed a set of user stories using these personas to better support all of these diverse end-users of smart parking apps
we prototyped such an app using React Native and perform a cognitive walk-through evaluation of it and a representative existing parking app, showing our prototype meets many more diverse end-user requirements
we discussed lessons learned from this research to improve human-centric smart city app development in general
